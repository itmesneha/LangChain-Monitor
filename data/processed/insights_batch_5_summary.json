Review the `bind_tools` function – confirm it’s functioning as expected.\n\nTECHNICAL INSIGHTS:\n1.  `merge` function:  The `merge` function’s design introduces a mismatch in data structures.\n2.  `UnstructuredMarkdownLoader`:  The loader is incorrectly interpreting `README.md` files as zip files.\n3.  `bind_tools`: The `bind_tools` function’s behavior is causing the `merge` function to fail.\n4.  Dependency issues: Missing dependencies are hindering the code's functionality.\n5.
